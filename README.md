# üå≥ NFT Reforestation Network

Welcome to NFT Reforestation Network, a Web3 platform that combats deforestation and climate change by allowing users to invest in real-world tree-planting projects through NFTs. Each NFT represents a virtual plot of land where trees are planted, with on-chain tracking of environmental impact like carbon sequestration and biodiversity growth. Funds from NFT sales directly support verified reforestation efforts, solving the real-world problem of inaccessible and non-transparent eco-investments.

## ‚ú® Features

üå± Mint NFTs representing virtual forest plots tied to real-world planting  
üí∞ Fund reforestation projects via NFT purchases and staking rewards  
üìä Track real-world impact with oracle-fed data on tree growth and carbon credits  
ü§ù Community governance for selecting new planting sites and partners  
üîÑ Marketplace for trading NFTs with royalty fees supporting ongoing projects  
‚úÖ Oracle verification for transparent impact reporting  
üèÜ Staking mechanism to earn eco-tokens for long-term holders  
üö´ Anti-fraud measures to prevent duplicate or invalid plot claims  
üìà Dashboard integration for viewing personalized environmental contributions  

## üõ† How It Works

This project is built using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain, leveraging its Bitcoin-secured layer for immutable and secure transactions. The system involves 8 interconnected smart contracts to handle minting, funding, tracking, governance, and more.

### Core Smart Contracts

1. **PlotNFT.clar**: Handles minting and managing NFTs for virtual plots. Each NFT stores metadata like plot location, tree count, and initial planting date.  
   - Functions: `mint-plot` (creates new NFT), `transfer-plot` (transfers ownership).  

2. **EcoToken.clar**: A fungible token (STX or custom SIP-10) for rewards and funding. Users earn tokens for staking NFTs or contributing to projects.  
   - Functions: `mint-tokens` (issues rewards), `transfer-tokens` (user transfers).  

3. **FundingPool.clar**: Manages pooled funds from NFT sales, distributing them to reforestation partners via multisig approvals.  
   - Functions: `deposit-funds` (adds to pool), `disburse-funds` (releases to verified partners).  

4. **ImpactOracle.clar**: Integrates off-chain data (e.g., satellite imagery or partner reports) to update on-chain impact metrics like CO2 absorbed.  
   - Functions: `submit-impact-data` (oracle feeds data), `get-impact` (queries metrics for a plot).  

5. **GovernanceDAO.clar**: Allows NFT holders to vote on new projects, partners, or fund allocations using a token-weighted voting system.  
   - Functions: `create-proposal` (submits new idea), `vote-on-proposal` (casts votes).  

6. **StakingVault.clar**: Enables users to stake NFTs for rewards, locking plots to earn eco-tokens based on holding duration and impact growth.  
   - Functions: `stake-plot` (locks NFT), `claim-rewards` (withdraws earned tokens).  

7. **Marketplace.clar**: A decentralized exchange for buying/selling NFTs with built-in royalties that feed back into the funding pool.  
   - Functions: `list-nft` (puts NFT for sale), `buy-nft` (executes purchase).  

8. **VerificationRegistry.clar**: Registers and verifies reforestation partners and plots to ensure authenticity, preventing fraud with unique hashes for each project.  
   - Functions: `register-partner` (adds verified entity), `verify-plot` (checks plot legitimacy).  

**For Investors/Users**  
- Purchase an NFT via the Marketplace or mint directly from a new project launch.  
- Stake your NFT in the Vault to earn EcoTokens while contributing to growth.  
- Monitor impact through the Oracle‚Äîquery real-time data on your plot's environmental benefits.  
- Participate in Governance to influence future plantings.  

**For Project Partners (e.g., NGOs)**  
- Register via VerificationRegistry with proof of legitimacy.  
- Receive funds from FundingPool after oracle-verified milestones (e.g., trees planted).  
- Submit impact updates to the Oracle for transparent reporting.  

This setup ensures transparency, as all transactions and data are on-chain, while solving deforestation by channeling crypto investments into verifiable real-world action. Deploy the contracts on Stacks, integrate with a front-end dApp for user interaction, and partner with oracles like Chainlink for off-chain data feeds. Let's green the planet, one NFT at a time!
